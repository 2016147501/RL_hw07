## Setup

See [installation.md](installation.md). It's worth going through this again since some dependencies have changed since homework 1. You also need to make sure to run `pip install -e .` in the `hw7` folder.

## Complete the code

There are TODOs in these files:

- `cas4160/networks/reward_predictor.py`
- `cas4160/agents/pg_agent.py`
- `cas4160/scripts/run_hw7.py`

See the [Assignment PDF](https://www.overleaf.com/read/rysvmxsysjnx#6ffea7) for more info.
